How to use Theme Changer.

(Pictures are in guide pictures folder: ThemeChanger\Guide pictures)


--------------------------------|| Creating windows themes ||--------------------------------

1. Open Windows settings app
2. Click on "Personalization" tab
3. Customize your system however you like (wallpaper, dark/light mode, cursor, sounds and
	accent color should work, but feel free to test other settings)
4. Go back to the "Personalization" tab and click on "Themes" button
5. Click "Save" button in the top of the screen (See picture no.1)
6. Right-click on the theme you created and press "Save theme for sharing" (See picture no.2)
7. Save your theme on your desktop
8. Repeat the process for every theme you want



----------------------|| Appending your themes to the Theme Changer ||----------------------

1. Go to your desktop and cut(CTRL + X) all your themes
2. Open the "Themes" folder: ThemeChanger\Themes
3. Paste(CTRL + V) your themes here
4. Delete the empty file there

You should be now ready to switch between your themes by running "theme changer" shortcut



------------------------------------|| Post Scriptum ||------------------------------------

You can move the "theme changer" shortcut anyway for easy access (I recommend putting it on 
	your desktop or taskbar)

You can now also delete the "Source" and "Guide pictures" 
	folders: ThemeChanger\Source; ThemeChanger\Guide pictures

If windows settings app open up every time you change your theme, unfortunately it is a
	windows "feature" that, to my information, cannot be disabled
